This is an HTML5 game for mobile and desktop.
It was designed for the "Game Off" annual game jam, where participants have 1 month to create a game based on a secret theme. The theme for this year’s Game Off was "MOONSHOT"

*For the Moon is Hollow* is built with JavaScript, CSS, and uses the HTML Canvas element. It uses CreateJS for canvas rendering and composition. The sound is a Shepard tone, a sound consisting of a superposition of sine waves separated by octaves, which, creates an auditory illusion of a tone that seems to continually descend in pitch.

It has been tested in Firefox,Chrome,Edge on Windows; Firefox,Chromium on Linux; Safari on iOS.
